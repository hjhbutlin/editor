<h1>2D Platformer & Level Editor</h1>

**very much a work in progress**

<h2>Motivation</h2>

I was keen to remind myself of the basics of HTML CSS and JS, as well as to try to create some kind of UI. I decided to create a 2D platformer level editor, where you could build and play your own level.

<h2>Complete So Far</h2>

- The editor works. Platforms and spikes can be added to the editor grid, spawn and goal positions can be modified.

- The player can be moved with a, d & space, and the logic for keeping it in the game grid works.

<h2>Current Challenge</h2>

Right now I'm fixing buggy edge detection, after which I will add hazard checks and respawning.
